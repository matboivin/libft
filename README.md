42 is a private, non-profit and tuition-free Computer Science school based on peer-to-peer learning and hands-on projects.


> First C project: many implementations of the Standard C Library functions, and additional functions.


## Description

In order to have a deeper understanding of C programming and data structures, 42 first school project is to implement some of the Standard C Library functions. It enables us to get a glimpse on basic algorithms and to create our own functions. The purpose is also to let us enrich this personal library in the future.

- Libc Functions: Standard C Library functions
- Additional functions: more functions required by 42
- Personal functions

The 'ft' in front of function's names stands for 'fourty two'.
