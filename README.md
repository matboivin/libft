# libft - 42

> Many implementations of the Standard C Library functions, and additional functions.

## Description

In order to have a deeper understanding of C programming and data structures, 42 first solo project is to implement some of the Standard C Library functions. It enables us to get a glimpse on basic algorithms and to create our own functions. The purpose is also to let us enrich this personal library in the future.

- Libc Functions: Standard C Library functions
- Additional functions: more functions required by 42
- Personal functions

The 'ft' in front of function's names stands for 'fourty two".
My functions currently lack documentation.
